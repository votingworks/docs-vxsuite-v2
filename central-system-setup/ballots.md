# Ballots

To print, view, or save ballots, use an Election Manager card to access VxAdmin. All ballot styles are found in the Ballots tab.

## Print or Save a Ballot

Select three options before printing a ballot:

* _`Official`_ or _`Test`_or_`Sample`_
* _`Absentee`_ or _`Precinct`_
* Number of copies

Once selected, simply click _`Print [Number] [Mode] [Type] Ballot(s)`_ to print your desired ballot(s). VxAdmin prints 1 Official Absentee ballot by default. To save a PDF, select _`Save Ballot as PDF`_.&#x20;

### Official vs. Test vs. Sample Ballots

#### Official Ballot

Official ballots should only be printed for marking by voters. These ballots are titled **Official Ballot** in the top-left ballot corner and will be tabulated when VxScan or VxCentralScan is in Live mode.

The number of official ballots printed can be found under the Reports tab by selecting _`Printed Ballots Report`_. The report can be reviewed on screen or printed.&#x20;

To have official ballots printed by a vendor, use the .pdfs found in the [ballot package](save-ballot-package.md).

#### Test Ballot

A test ballot should be used for testing purposes. Test ballots appear the same as an official ballot but are titled **Test Ballot** in the top-left ballot corner.

Test ballots will not be tabulated by default and are only read by the VxScan or VxCentralScan when in Test mode.

**Sample Ballot**

A sample ballot should be used for proofing, display, or demonstration use. Sample ballots will not be read by VxScan. Sample ballots are also available as .pdfs in the [ballot package](save-ballot-package.md). The .pdfs can be used to print them on larger paper.

### Absentee vs. Precinct Ballots

An absentee ballot should be used for absentee voting and a precinct ballot should be used for all precinct voters, including affidavit, curbside, and emergency voters. Absentee and precinct ballots are the same with the exception of a label printed in the top-left corner and on every page footer for absentee ballots. With a color printer, the label is printed as white text on purple background. With a black-and-white printer, the label is printed as white text on grey background.

If printing ballots outside of VxAdmin, please review the [Ballot Printing Specifications page](../reference/ballot-printing-specifications-and-supply-list.md) for important instructions.
